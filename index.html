        <h4>The Fear</h4>
        <p class="Section1">Early in my life I discovered I had a major disability.  A fear of heights!  I first realized it on a field day trip to the park with my kindergarten class.  I was five years old and couldn't play with my friends because they were all swinging from this gigantic contraption called a jungle gym.  I froze in shaking fear.  This fear made me dizzy and clinch to the floor as if my life depended on it.  What would lead me to take the sky you are probably wondering.  Read on...</p>

            <h4>The Inspiration</h4>
            <p class="Section1">My family and I moved from Jamaica Queens to Rosedale Queens right night to JFK airport when I was 8 yeas old.  From my backyard I would see huge Boeing 757 on final decent just inches from my nose (what it felt like at the time).  I wondered what it took to fly such machines...  Was it sheer will, bravery, unshakable nerves or something else.  I never lost this curiousity as I would finish schooling and start my career as an accountant.  Unsatisfied with my career and just plain bored, I had to find a challenge.  Something that would take me away from the every day and out of my comfort zone.  This would consume me during my long commutes to the office, during assigments at the office, my even longer commutes back home, and even my dreams!</p>
            <div>
                <h4>The Dream</h4>
                <p class="Section1">So I finally made the decision to go after my "higher" calling.  There was nothing else to do but to chase the dream.  I know there is a greater end to all this, I just hope it's all worth it in the end.</p>
